# How this site works

Statically generated by Next.js.
Next.js generates HAST (HTML AST) from Markdown posts using Remark and Rehype at compile time then React (runtime) generates components from the HAST via `rehype-react`.
For more info, please refer to [the repository](https://github.com/pocka/log.pocka.io).

## Fonts

| Style        | Font                                                         |

## CSS

Written from scratch.
Only layout things in components' styles.
Most of styles are done by element selectors :)

Are you curious about `calc(var(--baseline) * Nrem)` stuffs?
It's Vertical Rhythm.
There are many great articles explaining the technique so I would recommend you to search if you interested.

## Syntax Highlighting

Prism.js. Theme is `a11y-dark` from [`prism-themes`](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes).
